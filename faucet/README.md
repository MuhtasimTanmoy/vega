# Faucet

The faucet provides a way to deposit/mint new funds for vega builtin assets (for
now, maybe more will be supported later on). The faucet takes the form of an
http server exposing a REST API which triggers new chain events on the Vega.

In order to control exactly who is allowed to broadcast events to the network,
the [node configuration](../config/) contains a list of public keys allowed to
broadcast chain events. The faucet's keypairs must be on this list before it can
start allocating assets.

## Request rate limiting

To prevent the users to request unlimited amount of funds, the CoolDown field in
the configuration allow operator to specify a minimum amount of time between 2
request for funds.

## Spam prevention

In order to prevent spam from non-validator node, the faucet needs to be
connected to a validator node.

## Configuration

The configuration of the faucet is done through the vega config.toml file.

The allowlisted public key must be added in the following section.

```toml
[EvtForward]
  Level = "Info"
  RetryRate = "10s"
  BlockchainQueueAllowlist = ["c65af95865b4e970c48860f5c854c5ca8f340416372f9e72a98ff09e365aa0cf"]
```

The faucet also has its own configuration inside the vega config.toml file:

```toml
[Faucet]
Level = "Info"
CoolDown = "5h0m0s"
WalletPath = "/Users/jeremy/.vega/faucet-wallet"
Port = 1790
IP = "0.0.0.0"
[Faucet.Node]
Port = 3002
IP = "127.0.0.1"
Retries = 5
```

This configuration can be generated automatically when running `vega init`. The
following command will generate the faucet section in the configuration file,
and add the generated public key to the `EvtForward` allowlist section.

```shell
vega init -f --gen-dev-nodewallet --gen-builtinasset-faucet
```

## Run the faucet

The faucet can be started using the core vega command line:

```shell
vega faucet run
```

You can run the help for more details explanation on the available flags:

```
vega faucet run -h
```
