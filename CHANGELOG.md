## 0.28.0

*2020-11-25*

Vega release logs contain a ðŸ”¥ emoji to denote breaking API changes. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ is a new combination denoting something that may significantly change your experience - from this release forward, transactions from keys that have no collateral on the network will *always* be rejected. As there are no transactions that don't either require collateral themselves, or an action to have been taken that already required collateral, we are now rejecting these as soon as possible.

We've also added support for synchronously submitting transactions. This can make error states easier to catch. Along with this you can now subscribe to error events in the event bus.

Also: Note that you'll see a lot of changes related to **Pegged Orders** and **Liquidity Commitments**. These are still in testing, so these two types cannot currently be used in _Testnet_.

## 0.27.0

*2020-10-30*

This release contains a fix (read: large reduction in memory use) around auction modes with particularly large order books that caused slow block times when handling orders placed during an opening auction. It also contains a lot of internal work related to the liquidity provision mechanics.

## 0.26.1

*2020-10-23*

Fixes a number of issues discovered during the testing of 0.26.0.

### Improvements
- [#2463](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2463) Further reliability fixes for the event bus
- [#2469](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2469) Fix incorrect error returned when a trader places an order in an asset that they have no account for (was `InvalidPartyID`, now `InsufficientAssetBalance`)
- [#2458](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2458) REST: Fix a crasher when a market is proposed without specifying auction times

## 0.26.0

*2020-10-20*

The events API added in 0.25.0 had some reliability issues when a large volume of events were being emitted. This release addresses that in two ways:
 - The gRPC event stream now takes a parameter that sets a batch size. A client will receive the events when the batch limit is hit.
 - GraphQL is now limited to one event type per subscription, and we also removed the ALL event type as an option. This was due to the GraphQL gateway layer taking too long to process the full event stream, leading to sporadic disconnections.

These two fixes combined make both the gRPC and GraphQL streams much more reliable under reasonably heavy load. Let us know if you see any other issues. The release also adds some performance improvements to the way the core processes Tendermint events, some documentation improvements, and some additional debug tools.

## 0.24.0

*2020-09-04*

One new API endpoint allows cancelling multiple orders simultaneously, either all orders by market, a single order in a specific market, or just all open orders.

Other than that it's mainly bugfixes, many of which fix subtly incorrect API output.

### New

- [#2186](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2186) Add per-party rate-limit of 50 requests over 3 blocks

## 0.23.1

*2020-08-27*

This release backports a fix from the forthcoming 0.24.0 release that fixes a GraphQL issue with the new `Asset` type. When fetching the Assets from the top level, all the details came through. When fetching them as a nested property, only the ID was filled in. This is now fixed.

### Improvements

- [#2140](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2140) GraphQL fix for fetching assets as nested properties

## 0.23.0

*2020-08-10*

This release contains a lot of groundwork for Fees and Auction mode.

**Fees** are incurred on every trade on Vega. Those fees are divided between up to three recipient types, but traders will only see one collective fee charged. The fees reward liquidity providers, infrastructure providers and market makers.

* The liquidity portion of the fee is paid to market makers for providing liquidity, and is transferred to the market-maker fee pool for the market.
* The infrastructure portion of the fee, which is paid to validators as a reward for running the infrastructure of the network, is transferred to the infrastructure fee pool for that asset. It is then periodically distributed to the validators.
* The maker portion of the fee is transferred to the non-aggressive, or passive party in the trade (the maker, as opposed to the taker).

**Auction mode** is not enabled in this release, but the work is nearly complete for Opening Auctions on new markets.

ðŸ’¥ Please note, **this release disables order amends**. The team uncovered an issue in the Market Depth API output that is caused by order amends, so rather than give incorrect output, we've temporarily disabled the amendment of orders. They will return when the Market Depth API is fixed. For now, *amends will return an error*.

### Bugfixes
- [#2096](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/pull/2096) Fix concurrent map access in event forward

*2020-07-20*

This release primarily focuses on setting up Vega nodes to deal correctly with events sourced from other chains, working towards bridging assets from Ethereum. This includes responding to asset events from Ethereum, and support for validator nodes notarising asset movements and proposals.

It also contains a lot of bug fixes and improvements, primarily around an internal refactor to using an event bus to communicate between packages. Also included are some corrections for order statuses that were incorrectly being reported or left outdated on the APIs.
